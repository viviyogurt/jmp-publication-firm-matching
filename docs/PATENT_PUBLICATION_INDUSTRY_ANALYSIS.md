## 📊 Methodology

### Industry Classification

**Keyword-Based Classification** (7 categories):
1. Extract keywords from business descriptions and company names
2. Match to industry-specific keyword lists
3. Assign to mutually exclusive categories
4. Fallback to "Other" if no keywords match

**Keyword Lists:**
- **Technology/Software:** software, semiconductor, AI, cloud, internet
- **Pharma/Biotech:** pharmaceutical, drug, biotech, medical, clinical
- **Finance/Banking:** bank, financial, insurance, investment
- **Energy/Utilities:** oil, gas, energy, utility, power
- **Manufacturing/Industrial:** manufacturing, industrial, machinery
- **Retail/Consumer:** retail, consumer, restaurant, e-commerce
- **Other:** None of the above

### Strategy Classification

Firms classified into 3 strategy types based on patent-publication ratios:
- **Patent-focused:** patents/paper > 10
- **Publication-focused:** papers/patent > 0.5
- **Balanced:** Neither extreme

### Limitations

1. **Keyword classification:** May misclassify some firms
2. **Broad categories:** No sub-industry detail (e.g., biotech vs. pharma)
3. **Small "Other" category:** 15% of firms, likely heterogeneous
4. **No SIC codes:** Would provide more precise industry classification

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Substantial industry heterogeneity** in patent vs. publication strategies
2. **Tech is surprisingly publication-intensive** (0.10 papers/patent, highest ratio)
3. **Finance is extremely patent-focused** (689 patents/paper, lowest ratio)
4. **Pharma is most balanced** (75% balanced firms, 20:1 patent-to-paper ratio)
5. **Within-industry variation exists**, especially in Technology (46% vs. 50% split)
