You are helping validate patent assignee-to-firm matches. I have a CSV file with 1,000 matches that need manual validation.

FILE: validation_sample_1000.csv (located at: /home/kurtluo/yannan/jmp/data/processed/linking/validation_sample_1000.csv)

YOUR TASK:
For each row in the CSV, check if the assignee (assignee_clean_name) correctly matches the firm (firm_conm or conm). Then:
1. Fill the 'is_correct' column with: "Yes", "No", or "Uncertain"
2. Optionally add notes in 'validation_notes' column
3. Process all 1,000 rows systematically

VALIDATION CRITERIA:

Mark "Yes" if:
- Assignee name matches firm name exactly or closely
- Assignee is a subsidiary/division of the firm (e.g., "Microsoft Research" → Microsoft)
- Assignee is an abbreviation of firm (e.g., "IBM" → International Business Machines)
- Assignee name contains firm name or vice versa
- Business description (busdesc) aligns with assignee activities

Mark "No" if:
- Assignee is clearly a different, unrelated company
- Names are similar but refer to different entities
- Match appears to be a false positive

Mark "Uncertain" if:
- Cannot determine with confidence
- Need more context to verify
- Names are similar but unclear if same entity

KEY COLUMNS:
- firm_conm / conm: Firm company name
- assignee_clean_name: Assignee name that was matched
- tic: Ticker symbol
- busdesc: Business description (very useful - check if it mentions assignee)
- match_type: stage1 (exact), stage2 (fuzzy), stage3 (manual)
- match_method: How match was made
- match_confidence: 0.90-0.99

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Subsidiaries are CORRECT matches
- Name variations/abbreviations are CORRECT if same entity
- File sorted by confidence (lowest first) - harder matches come early
- Be conservative - use "Uncertain" when unsure

PROCESS:
1. Read the CSV file
2. For each row (starting row 1):
   a. Compare firm_conm/conm with assignee_clean_name
   b. Check busdesc if available
   c. Consider match_method and match_confidence
   d. Determine: Yes/No/Uncertain
   e. Update is_correct column
   f. Add notes if helpful
3. Save the updated CSV

Please process all 1,000 rows and provide the updated CSV file with the is_correct column filled in.
