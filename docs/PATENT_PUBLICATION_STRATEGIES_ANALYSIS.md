## 🏢 Firm-Level Heterogeneity

### Strategy Classification

Firms were classified into three types based on their patent-to-publication ratios:

**Patent-Focused Firms (1,074 firms, 48.8%)**
- High patent output relative to publications
- Mean: 514 patents, 2.0 papers
- Median patents-per-paper ratio: 6.0+

**Publication-Focused Firms (125 firms, 5.7%)**
- High publication output relative to patents
- Mean: 746 patents, 326 papers
- More balanced innovation strategy

**Balanced Firms (1,003 firms, 45.5%)**
- Moderate levels of both activities
- Mean: 2-6 patents, 0-10 papers
- Includes many smaller firms

### Top Firms by Strategy

#### Patent-Focused Leaders
| Firm | Patents | Papers | Patents/Paper |

5. Calculate ratios and strategy metrics

### Strategy Classification
- **Patent-focused:** Patents/paper > median (6.0)
- **Publication-focused:** Papers/patent > median
- **Balanced:** Neither extreme

### Period Analysis
- 5-year periods (1990-1994, 1995-1999, etc.)
- Focus on post-1990 (publication data quality)
- Exclude 2025 (incomplete year)
