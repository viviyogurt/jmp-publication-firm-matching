You are validating patent assignee-to-firm matches for a research project. Your task is to check if each assignee is correctly linked to its CRSP/Compustat firm.

TASK: For each row in validation_sample_1000.csv, determine if the match is correct and mark the 'is_correct' column.

VALIDATION RULES:
- Mark "Yes" if: assignee name matches firm name, is a subsidiary/division, is an abbreviation/variation, or clearly corresponds to the firm
- Mark "No" if: assignee is clearly a different company, unrelated entity, or false positive
- Mark "Uncertain" if: cannot determine with confidence, names similar but lack context, or need more research

KEY COLUMNS TO CHECK:
- firm_conm / conm: Firm company name
- assignee_clean_name: Normalized assignee name (what was matched)
- tic: Ticker symbol (for verification)
- busdesc: Business description (very helpful - check if it mentions assignee activities)
- match_type: stage1 (exact, high confidence), stage2 (fuzzy, medium), stage3 (manual)
- match_method: How match was made (exact_conm, ticker_in_name, fuzzy_jw_high, etc.)
- match_confidence: 0.90-0.99 (higher = more confident)

VALIDATION PROCESS FOR EACH ROW:
1. Compare firm_conm/conm with assignee_clean_name
2. Check if names are same, related, or assignee contains firm name
3. Review busdesc - does it align with assignee's likely activities?
4. Consider match_method - does it make sense for this match type?
5. Check match_confidence - high confidence should be more obvious
6. Make determination: Yes/No/Uncertain
7. Add brief notes in validation_notes if helpful (e.g., "subsidiary", "name change", "false positive")

EXAMPLES:
- "MICROSOFT CORP" → "MICROSOFT" = Yes (exact match)
- "MICROSOFT CORP" → "MICROSOFT RESEARCH" = Yes (subsidiary)
- "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES" → "IBM" = Yes (abbreviation)
- "APPLE INC" → "APPLE COMPUTER" (if different company) = No (false positive)
- "GENERAL TECH" → "GEN TECH" (unclear) = Uncertain (need more context)

IMPORTANT:
- Subsidiaries/divisions are CORRECT matches
- Name variations and abbreviations are CORRECT if they refer to same entity
- Be conservative - mark "Uncertain" when unsure
- File is sorted by confidence (lowest first) - most challenging matches come early

Start with row 1 and work through systematically. Update is_correct column for each row.
